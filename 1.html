<h2>Hello 안녕?</h2>
This is my <strong>first <u>web page </u> </strong> ever.Today is my second birthday! (maybe)
Now I am learing about the new line tag. He says I can have an enter key effect with a tag 'br.' Let me see.
<br>WOW!<br><br>WOW!x2<br>This tag doesn't need a closing tag.
<br> Then how about a tag p? It's a tag for making a pragraph. Let's grind out some outcomes with it. <p>You see?
These words here are surrounded by p tags! This tag is better in informative funciton as it shows the extent of information,
but it can only provide one line enter.
So here we utilize the CSS technology.If we put ' style="" ', we can bring in the CSS grammar.
In CSS, 'margin' means a blank between tags.
</p><p style="margin-top:45px;"> Now a new paragraph with margin on top of it of 45 pixels is made.</p><p style="margin-top:45px;">
Then let's print some image.<br><img src="danny.jpg" width="500">
<p>Now let's view how to anchor the link. It is done with a tag called
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a" target="_blank" title="try it!">'a'.</a>
Also it is set to be opened in a new tab with a order added ' target="_blank" '</p>
